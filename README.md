# Games

I enjoy playing board games and playing around wih new functions, so this repository is made up of games I've tried to build.

Not all are finished, none of them are styled heavily, but all of them not marked as "in progress" should be functional.

I did the bulk of the work for some of these when I was first starting with Ruby and OOP.  My other projects are a better measure of my current skills and style, but this shows some of the extra work I do for fun.
